# Bouncy text!

An attempt to create a bouncing-text effect for grub written in Rust. :)

I am currently studying the [GRUB source code](https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=grub) as well as the [UEFI documentation](https://uefi.org/specs/UEFI/2.10/12_Protocols_Console_Support.html?highlight=graphics) in order to get some kind of architecture started. What I know is that it will probably have to be a custom grub module. The goal is to implement a bouncing text effect for the [MineGRUB theme](https://github.com/Lxtharia/minegrub-theme) here on Github, similar to the actual Minecraft main menu. I also want to implement a way to display a compressed video loop or gif/webp looping image for the MineGRUB menu background.
